To realize the process described above, you would need the following accessories and components:

1. **Computer**:
   - A computer capable of running Python and OpenCV. This could be a laptop or desktop computer.

2. **Webcam**:
   - A webcam to capture the video feed. Most laptops come with built-in webcams, or you can purchase an external USB webcam.

3. **Arduino Uno**:
   - An Arduino Uno microcontroller board to control the engine.

4. **Engine**:
   - The engine you want to control. This could be a small DC motor, servo motor, stepper motor, etc., depending on your specific application.

5. **Motor Driver** (if required):
   - Depending on the type of engine you're using, you may need a motor driver to control it. For example, if you're using a DC motor, you'll need an H-bridge motor driver.

6. **Connecting Wires**:
   - Wires to connect the Arduino to the motor driver (if applicable) and to connect the motor driver to the engine.

7. **Breadboard** (optional):
   - A breadboard can be useful for prototyping and connecting components temporarily.

8. **Power Supply**:
   - A power supply for the Arduino and the engine. This could be a battery pack or a power adapter depending on your setup.

9. **Arduino USB Cable**:
   - A USB cable to connect the Arduino Uno to your computer for programming and communication.

10. **Resistors and Capacitors** (if required):
    - Depending on your specific circuit and components, you may need resistors and capacitors for protection or filtering purposes.

11. **Arduino Programming Software**:
    - You'll need the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed on your computer to write, compile, and upload code to the Arduino Uno.

12. **Python Environment**:
    - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer along with the necessary libraries such as OpenCV for computer vision tasks.

13. **Internet Access (for installing libraries)**:
    - If you don't have the necessary libraries installed, you'll need internet access to download and install them.

Here's a brief explanation of the connections:

- **Computer to Arduino**: Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer via USB cable. This is for programming the Arduino and for serial communication between the computer and Arduino.

- **Arduino to Motor Driver**: Connect digital pins of the Arduino (e.g., Pin 9) to the input pins of the motor driver module. These pins will be used to control the direction and speed of the motor.

- **Motor Driver to Engine**: Connect the output pins of the motor driver to the terminals of the engine. The motor driver will regulate the power supplied to the engine based on signals received from the Arduino.

- **External Power Supply**: Connect an external power supply to the motor driver module. This power supply should provide enough voltage and current to drive the engine effectively. Make sure the ground of the external power supply is connected to the ground of the Arduino to ensure a common reference voltage.

Please refer to the datasheets and manuals of your specific components (Arduino, motor driver, engine) for detailed pin configurations and wiring instructions. Additionally, be cautious about polarity and voltage requirements to prevent damage to your components.
